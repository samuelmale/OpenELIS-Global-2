# Feature Specification: Westgard Rules Quality Control Compliance

**Feature Branch**: `003-westgard-qc` **Created**: 2025-11-14 **Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "I want to create a specification for a new feature
that would implement lab instrument compliance functionality according to issue
OGC-41"

## User Scenarios & Testing _(mandatory)_

### User Story 1 - View Analyzer Compliance Status (Priority: P1)

As a laboratory technician, when I check the compliance status of instruments, I
want to see a clear overview with visual indicators so that I can quickly assess
which instruments require attention and which are operating normally.

**Why this priority**: This is the foundational capability that provides
immediate visibility into instrument quality control status, enabling
technicians to identify problems before processing patient samples.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by displaying a dashboard with
multiple instruments showing color-coded status (green/yellow/red) based on
pre-configured QC data, and delivers immediate value by showing compliance at a
glance.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** multiple instruments are running QC tests, **When** I view the
   compliance dashboard, **Then** I see each instrument displayed with its
   current compliance status indicated by color (green for compliant, yellow for
   warning, red for non-compliant)
2. **Given** an instrument has recent QC results, **When** I view its instrument
   card, **Then** I see the current compliance status, list of any triggered
   rules, and the date/time of the latest data point analyzed
3. **Given** I want detailed information about an instrument, **When** I click
   on an instrument card, **Then** I am taken to a detailed view showing control
   charts and historical data

---

### User Story 2 - Monitor QC Data with Control Charts (Priority: P1)

As a laboratory technician, when I need to understand why an instrument is out
of compliance, I want to view interactive Levey-Jennings charts with Westgard
rule overlays so that I can visually identify patterns and violations in the QC
data.

**Why this priority**: Control charts are essential for understanding the nature
of quality control violations and determining appropriate corrective actions.
This is a critical diagnostic tool.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by displaying a Levey-Jennings chart
for a single instrument with plotted QC results, standard deviation lines (±1SD,
±2SD, ±3SD), and highlighted violation points.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** an instrument has historical QC results, **When** I view its
   control chart, **Then** I see QC values plotted over time with clearly marked
   mean and standard deviation limits (±1SD, ±2SD, ±3SD)
2. **Given** QC results violate Westgard rules, **When** I view the control
   chart, **Then** violation points are highlighted with distinct colors and
   increased size
3. **Given** I hover over a data point on the chart, **When** the tooltip
   appears, **Then** I see the result value, z-score, date/time, and any rule
   violations for that point
4. **Given** I need to focus on a specific time period, **When** I apply date
   range filters, **Then** the chart updates to show only data within that range

---

### User Story 3 - Receive Automated Alerts for Rule Violations (Priority: P1)

As a lab manager, when Westgard rules are violated, I want to receive automated
alerts via email and system notifications so that I can take immediate
corrective actions before processing patient samples.

**Why this priority**: Timely notification of quality control failures is
critical for patient safety and regulatory compliance. Delays in addressing QC
issues can compromise test accuracy.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by triggering a QC rule violation
(e.g., entering a result that exceeds 3 standard deviations) and verifying that
email and in-system notifications are sent to configured recipients.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a rejection-level rule is violated (1₃ₛ, 2₂ₛ, R₄ₛ, 4₁ₛ, 10ₓ),
   **When** the violation is detected, **Then** automated alerts are immediately
   sent via email to lab managers and technicians
2. **Given** a warning-level rule is triggered (1₂ₛ, 3₁ₛ, 7ₜ), **When** the
   violation is detected, **Then** system notifications appear in the user's
   notification feed
3. **Given** multiple violations occur on the same instrument within 15 minutes,
   **When** alerts are generated, **Then** they are batched into a single
   notification to prevent alert fatigue
4. **Given** I receive an alert, **When** I click the notification link,
   **Then** I am taken directly to the detailed view of the affected instrument
   and violation

---

### User Story 4 - Manage Corrective Actions (Priority: P2)

As a laboratory supervisor, when a rule violation requires corrective action, I
want to log the actions taken and assign follow-up tasks so that we maintain a
complete audit trail and ensure violations are properly resolved.

**Why this priority**: Regulatory compliance requires documented corrective
actions for all quality control failures. This capability supports both
operational needs and audit requirements.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by creating a corrective action record
for a known violation, assigning it to a user, tracking status changes, and
verifying the violation is resolved when the action is completed.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a rejection-level violation exists, **When** I create a corrective
   action, **Then** I can select the action type (recalibration, maintenance,
   repeat control, reagent change, other), provide a description, and assign it
   to a specific user
2. **Given** a corrective action is assigned to me, **When** I view my task
   list, **Then** I see all pending corrective actions with their priority and
   due status
3. **Given** I complete a corrective action, **When** I mark it as completed
   with resolution notes, **Then** the associated violation is automatically
   resolved and the QC result is annotated with the corrective action summary
4. **Given** a violation has an active corrective action, **When** patient
   samples from that instrument are ready for release, **Then** they are held
   pending violation resolution

---

### User Story 5 - Configure Westgard Rules (Priority: P2)

As a laboratory manager, when setting up quality control for an instrument, I
want to configure which Westgard rules are enabled and their parameters so that
I can customize the quality control strategy to match our laboratory's needs and
regulatory requirements.

**Why this priority**: Different instruments and test methods may require
different quality control strategies. Configuration capability allows the system
to adapt to various laboratory environments and regulatory frameworks.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by configuring rule sets for a test
instrument, enabling/disabling specific rules, and verifying that rule
evaluation only applies the enabled rules.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** I am setting up QC for a test-instrument combination, **When** I
   access the rule configuration interface, **Then** I see all 8 available
   Westgard rules with options to enable/disable each one
2. **Given** I want a basic QC strategy, **When** I select a preset
   configuration (Basic, Standard, or Comprehensive), **Then** the appropriate
   rules are enabled automatically
3. **Given** I enable or disable rules, **When** I save the configuration,
   **Then** subsequent QC results for that test-instrument combination are
   evaluated using only the enabled rules
4. **Given** I disable all rejection-level rules, **When** I attempt to save,
   **Then** the system prevents me and displays a warning that at least one
   rejection rule must be enabled

---

### User Story 6 - Manage QC Control Lots (Priority: P2)

As a laboratory supervisor, when introducing a new control lot or batch, I want
to set up the control lot with its expected values and statistical parameters so
that the system can accurately evaluate QC results against the appropriate
standards.

**Why this priority**: Proper control lot management is foundational to accurate
QC evaluation. Each lot has unique statistical characteristics that must be
established before use.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by creating a new control lot,
configuring its statistical calculation method (initial runs, rolling, or
manufacturer fixed), and verifying that QC results are correctly evaluated
against the lot's parameters.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** I receive a new QC control lot, **When** I create the lot record,
   **Then** I enter the product name, lot number, level (Low/Normal/High),
   associated test and instrument, and activation dates
2. **Given** I am establishing statistics for a new lot, **When** I select the
   calculation method, **Then** I can choose from: initial establishment (first
   N runs, default 20), rolling calculation (moving window), or fixed
   manufacturer values
3. **Given** I select manufacturer fixed values, **When** I save the lot,
   **Then** the lot is immediately active and ready for QC result evaluation
4. **Given** I select initial establishment method, **When** I save the lot,
   **Then** the lot enters "establishment" status and does not evaluate Westgard
   rules until sufficient results are collected
5. **Given** a control lot has reached its expiration date, **When** I
   deactivate it, **Then** new QC results cannot be entered for that lot and the
   system prompts to set up a replacement lot

---

### User Story 7 - Analyze Compliance Trends (Priority: P3)

As a laboratory manager, when reviewing quality control performance, I want to
view trend graphs showing compliance over time so that I can identify recurring
issues, track improvements, and prepare for regulatory audits.

**Why this priority**: Trend analysis provides strategic insights for laboratory
quality improvement and helps demonstrate ongoing compliance to accreditors.
While important, it can be implemented after core operational features.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by generating trend reports for a date
range showing violation frequency by instrument, rule type, and severity, with
filtering and export capabilities.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** I want to review QC performance, **When** I access the trend
   analysis view, **Then** I see graphs showing compliance percentage over time
   with filtering options for date range, instrument, test, and rule type
2. **Given** I identify an instrument with recurring violations, **When** I view
   its trend graph, **Then** I can see which specific rules are triggering most
   frequently
3. **Given** I need data for an audit, **When** I export compliance reports,
   **Then** I can generate summary reports showing violations by instrument,
   rule type, time period, corrective action completion rate, and mean time to
   resolution
4. **Given** I want to compare multiple instruments, **When** I view the
   violation frequency distribution, **Then** I can identify which instruments
   have the highest violation rates

---

### User Story 8 - Integrate with Instrument Interfaces (Priority: P1)

As a laboratory technician, when analyzers complete QC runs, I want QC results
to be automatically captured from the instrument interface so that rule
evaluation happens without manual data entry and potential transcription errors.

**Why this priority**: Automated data capture eliminates manual entry errors and
enables real-time quality control evaluation. This is essential for operational
efficiency and data integrity.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by simulating ASTM messages from an
analyzer with QC results and verifying that results are correctly captured,
mapped to the appropriate control lot, and automatically evaluated against
configured rules.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** an analyzer sends QC results via ASTM interface, **When** the
   message is received, **Then** the system automatically maps the instrument
   ID, test code, control lot/level, and result value to internal records
2. **Given** a QC result is captured from the interface, **When** the result is
   saved, **Then** Westgard rules are automatically evaluated and any violations
   are immediately detected
3. **Given** the ASTM interface receives data for an unknown instrument or test,
   **When** mapping fails, **Then** the result is queued for manual review and
   the appropriate staff are notified
4. **Given** the ASTM interface is temporarily unavailable, **When** QC results
   need to be recorded, **Then** manual entry is available as a fallback method

---

### Edge Cases

- What happens when insufficient historical data exists to evaluate sequential
  rules (e.g., 10ₓ rule requires 10 previous results but only 5 are available)?

  - System should skip rules that cannot be evaluated and log an informational
    message
  - Dashboard should indicate when rules are not yet active due to insufficient
    data

- How does the system handle control lot changes mid-analysis?

  - Only results from the current active lot should be used for sequential rule
    evaluation
  - Switching lots resets the historical sequence for sequential rules

- What happens when multiple control levels (Low/Normal/High) are used for the
  same test?

  - Each control level is evaluated independently with its own statistics and
    rule configuration
  - Violations are tracked separately per level

- How does the system handle QC results entered out of chronological order?

  - System should accept results with any valid timestamp
  - Rule evaluation should consider chronological order based on timestamp, not
    entry order
  - Re-evaluation may be needed if out-of-order results affect sequential rules

- What happens when statistics are recalculated (e.g., when switching from
  initial to rolling calculation)?

  - System should provide option to re-evaluate all historical results with new
    statistics
  - Previous violations remain in audit trail but may be marked as
    "recalculated"

- How does the system handle instrument downtime or maintenance periods?

  - Gaps in QC data should not trigger sequential rules that span the gap
  - System should allow marking instruments as "under maintenance" to suppress
    alerts

- What happens when an alert recipient is unavailable (on leave, email bounces)?

  - System should have a backup notification chain
  - Undeliverable email alerts should be logged and escalated to administrators

- How does the system handle simultaneous violations of multiple rules?
  - All violated rules should be recorded in a single violation event
  - Notification should list all triggered rules with the most severe rule
    highlighted
  - Corrective action addresses all violations collectively
