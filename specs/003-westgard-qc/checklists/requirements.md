## Validation Results

### Content Quality Assessment

**✓ No implementation details**: The specification focuses on WHAT the system
must do, not HOW it should be implemented. No specific technologies, frameworks,
databases, or programming languages are mentioned.

**✓ Focused on user value and business needs**: All user stories clearly
articulate the value proposition ("so that I can...") and link capabilities to
business outcomes (patient safety, regulatory compliance, operational
efficiency).

**✓ Written for non-technical stakeholders**: The specification uses domain
language (QC control lots, Westgard rules, Levey-Jennings charts) familiar to
laboratory professionals, not technical jargon.

**✓ All mandatory sections completed**: User Scenarios & Testing, Requirements
(Functional + Constitution Compliance + Key Entities), and Success Criteria are
all fully populated.

### Requirement Completeness Assessment

**✓ No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain**: The specification contains zero
clarification markers. All requirements are fully specified based on the
comprehensive OGC-41 documentation and implementation guide.

**✓ Requirements are testable and unambiguous**: Each functional requirement
(FR-001 through FR-081) specifies a concrete capability that can be verified.
Examples:

- FR-028: "System MUST complete rule evaluation within 5 seconds" (testable
  performance requirement)
- FR-047: "System MUST use color-coded indicators: Green (all rules compliant),
  Yellow (warning-level violations present), Red (rejection-level violations
  present)" (unambiguous visual specification)

**✓ Success criteria are measurable**: All 19 success criteria include specific
metrics:

- SC-001: "within 10 seconds"
- SC-004: "95% of evaluations"
- SC-009: "less than 1% false positive/negative rate"

**✓ Success criteria are technology-agnostic**: Success criteria focus on user
outcomes, not implementation:

- SC-002: "automatically captured and evaluated" (not "using Spring async
  listeners")
- SC-007: "charts render within 3 seconds" (not "using Canvas rendering with
  D3.js")

**✓ All acceptance scenarios are defined**: Each of the 8 user stories includes
multiple Given-When-Then scenarios that describe expected behavior in testable
terms.

**✓ Edge cases are identified**: The specification addresses 8 critical edge
cases including:

- Insufficient historical data for sequential rules
- Control lot changes mid-analysis
- Multiple control levels
- Out-of-order result entry
- Statistics recalculation
- Instrument downtime
- Unavailable alert recipients
- Simultaneous multiple rule violations

**✓ Scope is clearly bounded**: The specification clearly defines:

- What's included: 8 specific Westgard rules, ASTM interface integration,
  dashboard visualization, corrective action workflow, alert system, reporting
- What's excluded/deferred: The spec focuses on QC quality control compliance,
  not general lab operations
- Dependencies: Existing ASTM interface (already exists), existing instrument
  and test entities, existing user/role system

**✓ Dependencies and assumptions identified**:

- Dependencies: Existing ASTM analyzer interface, existing test and instrument
  entities, existing user authentication and role system
- Assumptions documented in user stories: ASTM-enabled analyzers are the primary
  data source, laboratory follows standard QC practices (20-run establishment
  period), users have appropriate role assignments

### Feature Readiness Assessment

**✓ All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria**: The 81
functional requirements are organized by capability area and each specifies
measurable behavior. User stories provide the acceptance criteria in
Given-When-Then format that directly map to functional requirements.

**✓ User scenarios cover primary flows**: The 8 prioritized user stories cover
the complete lifecycle:

- P1: View compliance status, monitor charts, receive alerts, integrate with
  instruments (core operational features)
- P2: Manage corrective actions, configure rules, manage control lots (essential
  setup and workflow features)
- P3: Analyze trends (strategic/reporting features)

**✓ Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria**: Success
criteria align with functional requirements and user stories:

- Dashboard performance (SC-001, SC-007, SC-008) supports User Story 1
- Automated capture and evaluation (SC-002, SC-004, SC-009) supports User Story
  8
- Alert timing (SC-003, SC-013) supports User Story 3
- Audit compliance (SC-010, SC-015, SC-016) supports User Story 4

**✓ No implementation details leak into specification**: The specification
maintains technology-agnostic language throughout. Where technical concepts are
necessary (ASTM interface, Levey-Jennings charts, Westgard rules), they
represent domain-specific standards, not implementation choices.

## Notes

✅ **SPECIFICATION READY FOR PLANNING**

This specification is comprehensive, well-structured, and ready to proceed to
the `/speckit.plan` phase. Key strengths:

1. **Comprehensive Coverage**: Based on detailed OGC-41 issue and implementation
   guide, covering all 8 Westgard rules, complete workflow from data capture
   through corrective action, and full regulatory compliance requirements.

2. **Clear Prioritization**: User stories are prioritized P1-P3 with clear
   rationale, enabling phased implementation starting with core operational
   features.

3. **Regulatory Alignment**: Requirements explicitly address CLIA, CAP, and 21
   CFR Part 11 compliance needs through audit trails, corrective action
   documentation, and data retention.

4. **Measurable Success**: 19 success criteria provide clear targets for both
   quantitative performance (response times, accuracy rates, throughput) and
   qualitative outcomes (regulatory compliance, user confidence).

5. **Edge Case Coverage**: Proactively addresses complex scenarios like control
   lot transitions, insufficient data, out-of-order results, and simultaneous
   violations.

No further clarification or specification updates are required. The feature is
ready for architectural planning and task breakdown.
