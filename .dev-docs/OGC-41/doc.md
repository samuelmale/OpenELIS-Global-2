Description User story • As a laboratory technician, when I check the compliance
status of instruments, I want to see a clear overview so that I can quickly
assess any issues. • As a lab manager, when rules are violated, I want to
receive automated alerts so that I can take immediate corrective actions.
Context This issue focuses on designing a dashboard for instrument compliance.
The dashboard will provide an overview of compliance status, instrument-specific
details, control charts, historical data, alerts, and corrective actions.
Acceptance criteria • Overview section displays compliance status with visual
indicators: o Green for compliant o Yellow for warning o Red for out of
compliance • Each instrument has a card with: o Current compliance status o List
of triggered rules o Date and time of the latest data point analyzed • Clickable
feature for detailed views, including control charts. • Interactive
Levey-Jennings charts integrated for each instrument. • Westgard Rule limits
overlaid on control charts. • Points violating rules are highlighted. • Trend
graphs show compliance over time with filtering options. • Automated alerts sent
via email or system notifications for rule violations. • Real-time feed for
ongoing compliance issues. • Log for corrective actions taken and task
assignments for follow-up. Other information • Use color-coded visuals for
clarity. • Responsive design for various devices. • Customizable thresholds and
rule sets. • Search or filter bar for quick access to instruments or violations.
• Dashboard linked to the lab information system (LIS) for live data feeds. •
Data synchronized from instruments at regular intervals via ASTM interface or
flat file import. • Sensitive data protected with encryption and secure user
authentication. • System designed for scalability to support additional
instruments or rules. Mockup: https://kit-mango-37758223.figma.site

The Westgard Rules are a set of statistical quality control guidelines used in
laboratories to monitor the accuracy and precision of analytical systems. These
rules help determine whether a test run is "in control" or "out of control" by
analyzing patterns in control measurements. They are commonly applied using
Levey-Jennings charts, which plot control data against standard deviation
limits2. Some key Westgard Rules include: • 1 2s Rule: A warning rule triggered
when one measurement exceeds 2 standard deviations from the mean. • 1 3s Rule:
Rejects a run if one measurement exceeds 3 standard deviations from the mean. •
2 2s Rule: Rejects a run if two consecutive measurements exceed 2 standard
deviations on the same side of the mean. • R 4s Rule: Rejects a run if one
measurement exceeds +2 standard deviations and another exceeds -2 standard
deviations within the same run. • 4 1s Rule: Rejects a run if four consecutive
measurements exceed 1 standard deviation on the same side of the mean. • 10 x
Rule: Rejects a run if ten consecutive measurements fall on one side of the
mean3. These rules are designed to minimize false alarms while maximizing error
detection, ensuring reliable laboratory results. They are particularly useful in
clinical chemistry, hematology, and immunoassays2. Comment by Casey Iiams-Hauser

Dashboard Layout and Visual Elements

1. Overview Section This section provides a summary of compliance status for all
   instruments: • Visual Representation: A grid or table with color-coded status
   indicators: o Green for compliance. o Yellow for warning (e.g., Rule 1 2s
   triggered). o Red for non-compliance (e.g., Rule 1 3s violated). • Mockup:
   Imagine rows labeled with instrument names, accompanied by compliance status
   icons (✔️, ⚠️, ❌), percentages of compliance, and timestamps for the latest
   data.
2. Instrument-Specific Details Each instrument has its own card or section: •
   Visual Representation: Cards with information such as: o Current compliance
   status. o List of triggered rules (e.g., "R 4s violated on [date/time]"). o
   Data visualization icons for further exploration. • Mockup: A sleek card for
   each instrument, showing the last five tests and highlighting rules that were
   breached.
3. Control Charts Interactive Levey-Jennings charts for each instrument: •
   Visual Representation: o Plot control data with standard deviation limits
   clearly marked. o Highlight data points that violate Westgard Rules (e.g.,
   red points for violations). • Mockup: Visualizing a graph with an “overlaid”
   zone for ±1s, ±2s, and ±3s, with flagged points that exceed the limits.
4. Historical Data & Trends Graphical insights into compliance over time: •
   Visual Representation: o Trend graphs to identify recurring issues and
   compliance improvement over months. o Filtering tools for date ranges or
   specific instruments. • Mockup: Imagine a line graph labeled with the
   percentage of runs in compliance, annotated with significant rule violations.
5. Alerts & Notifications This section flags rule violations: • Visual
   Representation: o A scrolling feed with real-time updates for non-compliance
   cases. o Notifications panel for lab managers. • Mockup: Notifications could
   appear as cards labeled “Rule 1 3s triggered - Instrument X,” dated and
   prioritized.
6. Corrective Actions Log Tracking corrective actions taken: • Visual
   Representation: o A log with timestamps, actions performed (e.g.,
   recalibration), and who handled the task. • Mockup: A list view with sortable
   columns for date, instrument, corrective action, and status.

here's a textual mockup of one of the sections:

Instrument Compliance Overview Instrument Name Status Compliance % Last Checked
Action Required Analyzer A 🟢 Compliant 98% March 24, 2025 No action Analyzer B
🟡 Warning 85% March 23, 2025 Investigate rule violations Analyzer C 🔴 Out of
compliance 65% March 22, 2025 Immediate calibration needed

Mockup is here for the UI: https://urban-poster-21038766.figma.site

Comment by Ian Bacher [ 07/Nov/25 ]

I don’t think the actual UI code gets us very far, but I do think having the
design mock artifacts is fantastic! Probably after this current push we should
see if we can integrate IBM’s Figma for Carbon kit with our Figma setup… That’s
more likely to get us to an easily usable artifact. Comment by Male Samuel [

A few questions regarding the overall scope of work for this feature:

1. Analyzer Coverage: Is this feature intended to work exclusively with
   ASTM-enabled analyzers, or should we design it to support other communication
   protocols as well (e.g., HL7, CSV imports, or direct OpenELIS data entry)?
2. Analyzer Configuration UI: Do we already have a UI for configuring or mapping
   ASTM-enabled analyzers, or would part of this work involve creating a
   configuration panel for instrument setup and QC data mapping?
3. Backend Components: While I see that we already have plugins for instrument
   communication, do we currently have backend components for: o A Westgard rule
   evaluation service or basic rule engine o QC-related database models o An
   alerting or notification service for rule violations Or should these be
   developed as part of this story’s implementation?
4. Rule Definition and Management: How do we plan to define and maintain the
   Westgard rules? Should rules be configurable through a UI (for admins to add
   or modify), or are we expecting them to be defined via configuration files?
5. Data Flow: Are QC results expected to be synchronized in real time from
   analyzers, or will there be scheduled batch imports? Comment by Casey

Male Samuel I’ve added some more details above, which detail out the rules for
the rule builder, we do indeed already have a mechanism to connect to the
analyzers to OpenELIS, and there is a different story to enable the mapping.
This would be to build out the rules to run the checks against the QC data, and
then show the alerts, and log corrective actions. Generated at Fri Nov 14
